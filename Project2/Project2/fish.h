//This models a creature that is intelligent enough to remember some capacity of characters at a time. But, a Fish might not use up its entire capacity, it might just remember some amount that is less than its capacity. For example a Fish might be able to remember 10 characters, but may only have encountered 2 so far.

public:
    Fish(int capacity, std::string name);// Constructor
    Fish(const Fish &other); // Copy Constructor
    virtual ~Fish(); // Destructor
    Fish &operator=(const Fish &other); // Assignment Operator
    virtual void remember(char c); // Remember c
    virtual void forget(); // Clears memory by filling in '.'
    virtual void printMemory() const;// Prints memory
    std::string getName();
protected:
    const char* getMemory() const;// Returns memory
    int getAmount() const; // Returns amount remembered
    int getCapacity() const; // Returns memory capacity
