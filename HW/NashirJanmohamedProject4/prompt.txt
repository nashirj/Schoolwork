In this project, you will develop a simple spell checker program that spots misspelled words in a file by checking each word in the file against a provided reference dictionary.

A list of correctly spelled English words is provided as a reference (ref.txt). There is one word per line in this file. The user file to be checked is a text file where each space-separated word of the file is to be examined.  Punctuations, case, and numbers should be ignored. If a word from the file does not exist in the provided list then it is assumed to be misspelled.

After identifying the misspelled words, the program should prompt the user to enter a word and it should report the number of times the word appeared in the file.

Your program must do the following:

Read the refernece file “ref.txt”. This file consists of words, one word per line. Use a dictaionry container to store the words that are in the ref.txt.
Prompt the user for the name of the file to spell check. Program should read the words in the file and store the words in a dictionary container where the keys are the words in the file and values are the number of times the word is used in the file.
Spellcheck each word and then display the words that were misspelled.
Prompt the user to enter a word and return the number of times the word was used in the file
Notes:

Make sure to eliminate the punctuation when constructing the dictionary from the input file
If numbers are being use in the input file, they shouldn’t be spellchecked
sample.txt file is provided as a test case. Make sure your program provides the same results as shown below:
