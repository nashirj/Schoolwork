Homework

When submitting your assignments make sure to clearly indicate the assignment number and chapter to which it corresponds. Always submit each assignment separately; do not staple different assignments together. You are only required to submit work only for the problems. However, you should also definitely attempt to think carefully about the assigned questions.
